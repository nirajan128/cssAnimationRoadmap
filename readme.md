# [CSS Animation Roadmap](https://nirajan128.github.io/cssAnimationRoadmap/)

Welcome to the CSS Animation Roadmap project! This open-source initiative aims to provide a comprehensive guide to CSS animations, focusing on three main properties: Transition, Animation, and Transform. Each property is explained with live examples to help you grasp their concepts effectively.

## Transition

The `transition` property in CSS allows you to smoothly change the values of CSS properties over a specified duration. With transitions, you can create simple animations like hover effects or more complex transitions between different states of an element.

Explore the examples provided to understand how transitions work and how you can use them to enhance your web designs.

## Animation

CSS animations provide more control and flexibility compared to transitions. With the `@keyframes` rule, you can define custom animations with multiple keyframes, specifying different styles at various points in time.

Discover the power of CSS animations through the live examples included in this roadmap. Learn how to create engaging animations that bring your web pages to life.

## Transform

The `transform` property allows you to modify the appearance and layout of elements in 2D and 3D space. With transformations like scaling, rotating, skewing, and translating, you can manipulate elements in creative ways without affecting the document flow.

Dive into the examples showcasing various transform effects to master this powerful CSS property and add depth and dimension to your designs.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this project by creating pull requests. Let's collaborate to make CSS animations more accessible and understandable for everyone!
